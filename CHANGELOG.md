# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `LICENSE` (MIT). The README declared the license but the file was never committed.
- Classic-installer packaging restored alongside the Skills-as-modules manifests, so the same
  release installs through both routes: `skills/module.yaml` + `skills/module-help.csv`
  (BMM 6.12.0 canonical help schema) and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
  `npx bmad-method install --custom-source <repo>` (Discovery mode) and
  `--custom-source <repo>/skills` (Direct mode) now register the module as
  `bmad-issue-tracking` with its version instead of an anonymous `skills` module.
- `tests/test_packaging.py`: module code, semver version string, skill list, manifest `knowledge`
  targets and help-CSV header/rows must agree across `module.yaml`, `marketplace.json`, every
  `module-manifest.toml` and the newest `CHANGELOG.md` release heading, in the shapes the
  6.12.0 installer's line-based parsers actually accept.

### Changed

- `/bmad-issue-tracking-sync` runs the prepare and sync workflows and nothing else. Its
  steps 3 and 4 described routing on `BMAD_MR_ACTION` / `BMAD_ISSUE_ACTION` environment
  variables to reach single atomics; no workflow file ever read them, the workflow language
  has no environment channel, and `test_command_patterns.py` rejects `$var` in any step, so
  a caller following those steps got the full sync instead of the scoped operation.
- README and `CLAUDE.md` describe both install routes truthfully: BMAD 6.12.0 ships only the classic installer with the `_bmad/{bmm,core,...}/` layout; the Skills CLI /
  `module-manifest.toml` distribution is BMAD `main` (6.13.0-next), unreleased, and the two
  routes never coexist in one project. Previous text claimed 6.12.0 had adopted
  Skills-as-modules and a flat `_bmad/{method,toolbox}/` layout.

### Fixed

- The setup skill's `references/help.md` sent readers to `_bmad/_config/custom/issue-tracking.yaml`
  for the sidecar config; `common/check-config.yaml` reads `_bmad/custom/issue-tracking.yaml`.
  Its title also named the module `issue-tracking` instead of `bmad-issue-tracking`, and the
  close-trace-mr README credited the deploy to setup "step 3d", which is step 5.
- `common/create-issue.yaml`: the `TRUE:`/`FALSE:` branches of the inner
  `CHECK: empty issue_id` sat at the same indentation as the `- CHECK` item itself, so the
  block only read as a conditional by luck (both branches `STOP`, so either reading ended the
  workflow). They are now nested under the CHECK.
- The MR for a story named a source branch that does not exist on the remote: the create-story and
  dev-finish phases derived it from `branch_patterns.story` (`feat/<prd_key>/<story_key>`) while the
  work sits on the branch the run is actually on, so `gh pr create --head` failed and the step's
  `2>&1 | grep https://` stored an empty MR URL.
- The dev-finish and review-finish phases of `common/post-dev-complete.yaml` pushed with a bare
  `git push`, which exits 128 on a branch that has no upstream — the shape bmad-loop creates
  (`bmad-loop/<run>/<story_key>`) — and took the CI gate, the issue update and the comment with it.
- Re-running the `bmad-prd`, `create-prd` or `retrospective` completion hook on an unchanged
  worktree halted it: `git commit -m` exits 1 with "nothing to commit" on a clean tree and the
  step expects 0, so push, issue and MR never happened.
- `common/merge-mr.yaml` compared the git platform against the tracker platform with `neq`,
  an operator the workflow language does not define (it has `ne`), on both the GitLab and the
  GitHub branch.
- `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` reported `timeout` for every running pipeline on both
  platforms: the block mapping the pipeline status onto the `ci_status` enum used `sys.argv`
  without `import sys` and sent its stderr to `/dev/null`, so the status was always empty, the
  loop never broke and 60 polls × 30 s elapsed before the workflow gave up.
- A pipeline that ran longer than the interpreter's Bash tool allows left no `ci-status.json`:
  `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` spent its whole 30-minute budget inside one command
  (`sleep 30` × 60 attempts), and that command is killed at 600 s at the latest, so `ci_status`
  was never stored, `common/write-ci-status.yaml` never ran and bmad-loop's `[verify]` failed
  for the wrong reason. The same 30 minutes are now a `LOOP` of nine rounds, each a single
  command of at most 8 polls × 25 s (~200 s) that stores `ci_status`; iterations after a
  terminal state do nothing, and a run that is still `running` after the ninth round yields
  `timeout` exactly as before.
- Issue sync stopped after the first issue it created: the `sync_created` counter in
  `common/sync-issues.yaml` ran `int(sys.argv[1]) + 1` in a `python -c` body with no
  `import sys`, so the step raised `NameError` and halted the workflow.
- A story's status, comments and closure landed on another story's issue. `search=` is a
  fuzzy, index-ranked full-text query on both trackers — `1-1-login-form` also returns
  Story 1.10 and Story 11.1, `Epic 1:` also returns `Epic 10:` — and `common/find-issue.yaml`
  took the first hit. It now selects the issue whose body carries the exact
  `**Sprint Key:** <key>` marker (key-shaped lookups) or whose title equals, then literally
  starts with, the search text (`PRD: <key>`, `Epic <n>:`), and returns nothing when no
  issue matches. `common/create-issue.yaml`'s GitLab lookup adopted `issues[0]` for the same
  reason and now compares titles like its GitHub counterpart.
- The sprint-status entry leaked into every issue title and temp file: the interpreter
  renders a map item as `key: status`, so `common/sync-issues.yaml` produced titles like
  `Story 1.1: Login Form: Backlog` and files like `/tmp/issue-desc-epic-1: in-progress.md`.
  The loop body now derives `entry_key` and `entry_status` once, accepting both the
  `"key: status"` rendering and the bare key the language specifies.
- Story issues were created titled `Story 1.1: ` and synced to `Story 1.1: Intent`: BMM
  6.12.0's spec template has no `# ` heading — the title is in the frontmatter and the first
  heading is `## Intent` inside `<intent-contract>`. `common/ensure-issue.yaml` and
  `common/sync-issues.yaml` now read `title:` from the frontmatter, fall back to a real H1
  (the pre-6.12.0 shape) and only then to the story key.
- `/bmad-issue-tracking-setup` looked for its own assets only in the classic installer's URL
  clone cache and otherwise asked the user for a repo path. It now resolves the installed skill
  folder (`.claude/skills/…`, `.agents/skills/…`, cache, then ask)
  once and reuses it for TOML overrides, workflows, `ci-status.sh` and the close-trace-mr plugin.
- Setup step 1 read the BMM version from `.agents/skills/*/module-manifest.toml` on the assumption
  that 6.12.0 installs that way; on a classic install it now reads `_bmad/_config/manifest.yaml`
  first, and the error message no longer tells classic users to run `npx skills add`.
- Setup step 3 copied `bmad-workflow-lang.md` into `_bmad/_config/custom/` before creating the
  directory, which does not exist on a fresh classic install.
- Setup step 3's verify list missed four shipped `common/` workflows (`find-mr`, `get-failed-jobs`,
  `get-mr-pipeline`, `merge-mr`), so a consumer could lack them and the installer stay green.
  `tests/test_setup_verify_list.py` now pins the list to `assets/`.
- The sync skill's `module-manifest.toml` pointed `knowledge` at the setup skill's help file instead of
  its own `references/help.md`; that help file still required BMM 6.11.0 and read the version only
  from the legacy `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml`.
- Setup could not find its assets on a classic install for tools other than Claude Code; any
  `*/skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/` under the project root is now a candidate.
- The README override table lacked rows for `bmad-build.toml` and `bmad-build-auto.toml`;
  `tests/test_setup_verify_list.py` now pins the table to `assets/custom/` as well.
- Every `PRD: <key>` and `Epic <n>:` issue lookup missed: the search text went raw into the
  query URL, so its space reached the wire. GitHub answered `PROTOCOL_ERROR` and the trailing
  `| python` hid it — the step exited 0 with an empty result and the PRD issue looked absent,
  so sync created a duplicate; GitLab answered HTTP 400 and `glab` exit 1 halted the workflow.
  `common/find-issue.yaml` and `common/create-issue.yaml` now pass the search text as a `-f`
  request field (`--method GET`), which both CLIs percent-encode, and the GitHub search runs
  under `set -o pipefail` so a failed `gh api` can no longer be read as "no issue found".
- Issue sync broke on a PRD with more than 100 issues: `gh api --paginate` and
  `glab api --paginate` concatenate the pages with no separator, so `json.load` raised
  `JSONDecodeError: Extra data` on the second page. The bulk fetches in `common/sync-issues.yaml`
  and the GitHub search in `common/find-issue.yaml` now read the stream with
  `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode`, which accepts any number of pages.
- The first story or epic issue of a PRD was never created: `common/create-issue.yaml` decided
  "does this issue exist?" with a `FILTER … where: title matches`, and a FILTER that matches
  nothing stops the workflow (language §5). Once the PRD issue carried the `prd:<key>` label the
  listing was never empty, so the `empty search_result` guard did not catch it and every hook
  halted on the issue it was about to create. The lookup is now a `RUN` that prints the issue id —
  exact title first, prefix second — or an empty string, and reads the `--paginate` stream with
  `json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode` so any number of pages parses.
- GitHub CI status was read repo-wide: `common/get-mr-pipeline.yaml` and the poll and failure
  paths of `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` ran `gh run list --limit 1` with no `--branch`, so the
  newest run of ANY branch was reported as this MR's pipeline — a green story branch inherited an
  unrelated red one and the CI gate blocked it. They now filter on `{source_branch}`, and
  `get-mr-pipeline` targets `{mr_repo}` instead of the issue tracker's `{host}/{project}`, which
  are not the same repo when the git remote and the tracker are on different platforms.
- A successful GitHub merge was reported as `merged=false`: `common/merge-mr.yaml` derived the
  result from the merge CLI's stdout, and `gh pr merge` exits 0 with zero bytes of it. The gh
  steps now append `&& echo merged`, so stdout carries the exit code the file header always
  named as the truth source. Reading `merge_commit_sha` instead would have inverted the other
  way — GitHub returns a test-merge SHA for an open PR.
- A setup whose issue tracker and git remote sit on different platforms could not merge and
  never polled its CI. `common/merge-mr.yaml` chose the merge CLI by `platform` (the tracker),
  so with issues on GitHub and code on GitLab it ran `gh pr merge` against a GitLab repo path,
  and its GitHub branch named `{git_owner}`/`{git_repo}`, which `common/check-config.yaml` never
  defines — three callers derived them on the atomic's behalf and the fourth did not, halting
  the workflow on language §4.5. `merge-mr` now reads `git_host`/`git_project` from the config
  itself, so no caller seeds anything. The same mismatch ran through every MR/PR and CI step:
  the enclosing `CHECK: git_platform eq …` picked the right branch and the step's `PLATFORM:`
  annotation — which compares against the tracker — then skipped the RUN inside it, so nothing
  was stored and the caller read the empty value as "no MR" or, after nine silent poll rounds,
  as a 30-minute CI timeout. `common/find-mr.yaml`, `common/get-mr-pipeline.yaml`,
  `common/merge-mr.yaml`, `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` and `common/get-failed-jobs.yaml` now
  carry no `PLATFORM:` annotation and are selected by `git_platform` alone; the rule is written
  down in `bmad-workflow-lang.md` §2.4 and enforced by `tests/test_platform_coverage.py`.
- Issue sync never recognised the retrospective issue it had created: the description written by
  `retrospective/complete.yaml` lacked the ``**Sprint Key:** `epic-<n>-retrospective` `` marker
  every other producer writes, and a key-shaped lookup selects on exactly that marker. There was
  no duplicate — `common/create-issue.yaml` adopts the issue by its exact title — but every sync
  counted the retrospective as newly created and left its status label unreconciled.
- A successful GitHub merge halted the workflow one step later: `common/merge-mr.yaml` read the
  merge commit with the host inside the API path (`gh api repos/github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>`),
  which answers 404, and the step carries no `EXPECT_EXIT: any`. The host now travels in
  `--hostname`, the shape the rest of the module uses, on both the same-platform and the
  cross-platform branch.
- An MR/PR description holding a double quote, a backtick or a `$(...)` substitution was
  taken apart by the shell before the CLI saw it: `common/ensure-mr.yaml` interpolated the
  body into `--body`/`--description`, so the shell ran the substitution, `gh` answered
  `unknown argument` and created nothing — and the step's trailing `2>&1 | grep https` gave
  that exit 0 and an empty MR URL, so the caller carried on as if the MR existed. The body
  now travels as a file (`--body-file` / `--description-file`), the title is one
  single-quoted argument, and the create's own exit code reaches the caller.
- A failed bulk fetch made the tracker look empty and the whole sprint look unsynced: the
  two bulk fetches of `common/sync-issues.yaml` piped `glab api` / `gh api --paginate` into
  python without `set -o pipefail`, so a CLI failure (auth, network, rate limit) still
  exited 0 with an empty `issue_index`. Every entry then looked new — `create-issue` adopts
  by exact title, so no duplicates, but no status was reconciled and the counters lied.
- On GitHub a just-created issue was invisible to the next lookup for several seconds, so
  sync-issues walking a sprint — or a create-story phase followed by dev-finish in the same
  minute — read an empty `issue_id` and skipped the status update. A key-shaped lookup
  (`1-1-login-form`, `epic-1`, `epic-1-retrospective`) now reads the REST list endpoint
  scoped by the PRD label, the one `create-issue.yaml` uses, and selects on the
  `**Sprint Key:**` marker locally instead of taking the search index's top hit; and
  because NEITHER GitHub endpoint is read-your-writes — measured on the lab, 3.7-7.7 s for
  the issue list and about as long for `search/issues` — a miss is re-checked up to three
  times, 3 s apart, within the same step. The `PRD: <key>` / `Epic <n>:` title shapes keep
  the search API. GitLab is unaffected.
- With code on a GitLab remote and issues on GitHub, the CI atomics polled the issue
  tracker's project: the GitLab steps of `common/get-mr-pipeline.yaml`,
  `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` and `common/get-failed-jobs.yaml` addressed
  `projects/{project_enc}` with `--hostname {host}`, and the dev-finish and create-story
  phases of `common/post-dev-complete.yaml` set `mr_repo` to `{host}/{project}` outright.
  `common/check-config.yaml` now resolves the git remote's coordinates once
  (`git_host`, `git_project`, `git_project_enc`, `mr_repo`) beside the tracker's, and every
  MR/PR and CI step reads them from there. The four private copies of that resolution are
  gone, and with them the `git_owner`/`git_repo` split-and-rejoin of
  `bmad-prd/complete.yaml`, `create-prd/complete.yaml` and `common/mark-mr-ready.yaml`.
- The first dev-finish of a story wrote `ci-status.json` green without checking any CI: the
  dev-finish phase of `common/post-dev-complete.yaml` ran the CI gate before `ensure-mr`, so
  on the first pass there was no PR yet, `check-mr-ci` mapped `no_mr` and `write-ci-status`
  wrote green — and only then was the PR created. Under bmad-loop the first `[verify]`
  therefore passed whatever CI did, and a red pipeline was first seen one pass later. The
  issue and the MR are now ensured before the gate. `no_mr` still maps to green: that is the
  flow with no remote MR at all, not a story whose MR had not been created yet.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-15

[compare v2.2.0...v3.0.0](https://github.com/jrevillard/bmad-issue-tracking/compare/v2.2.0...v3.0.0)

### Changed

- **Install mechanism migrated to Skills-as-modules.** Each skill folder now ships its own `module-manifest.toml` declaring `module = "issue-tracking"`. The legacy `module.yaml`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `module-help.csv`, and auto-generated `skills-lock.json` are removed. The new installer reads each `<skill>/module-manifest.toml` instead of the old `--custom-source` flow.
- Renamed skill `bmad-bmm-issue-sync` → `bmad-issue-tracking-sync` (dropped the `bmm-` prefix; the module is no longer a BMM extension, just a flat BMad module).
- Moved bmad-loop integration scripts from `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/assets/bmad-loop/` to `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/scripts/bmad-loop/` and `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/scripts/close-trace-mr/`. The setup skill's `module-manifest.toml` declares these in its `scripts = [...]` field so the new installer publishes them.
- TOML overrides (`assets/custom/bmad-*.toml`), workflow YAMLs (`assets/workflows/**`), and `assets/bmad-workflow-lang.md` keep their current locations — they remain consumer-deployed `cp` payloads driven by the setup skill.
- Version bumped to **3.0.0** (major: install mechanism change is not backward-compatible).
- `bmad-create-story.toml`, `bmad-dev-story.toml`, `bmad-code-review.toml`: `on_complete` hooks now delegate to the unified wrapper workflows instead of running the post-completion logic inline. Single source of truth for the issue-tracking lifecycle.
- Removed the `story-track-dev` and `story-track-review` bmad-loop plugins. They were redundant: the `bmad-build-auto.toml` `on_complete` hook (which the bmad-build-auto skill executes at the end of every session — including when bmad-loop invokes it) already drives the unified workflow. The setup step 3c now deploys only `ci-status.sh`; no `[plugins] enabled` entries are needed.
- `ci-status.sh`: missing or invalid `ci-status.json` now exits `1` (fixable) instead of `126` (env-fault). The bmad-loop verify classification changes accordingly: missing ci-status.json triggers a repair session instead of a CRITICAL escalation, so the bmad-loop run can self-heal across multiple stories.
- **Requires BMM 6.12.0+** (was 6.4.0+): targets the 6.12.0 skill set — `bmad-ux`, consolidated `bmad-sprint-planning`, `uv`-based tooling. Version gate in setup updated.
- All Python invocations in workflow YAMLs migrated from `python3 -c` to `uv run python -c` (BMM 6.12.0 makes `uv` a real requirement and stops assuming a system Python).
- `bmad-create-ux-design` override renamed to `bmad-ux` (workflow `create-ux-design/` → `bmad-ux/`) — the skill was removed in BMM 6.12.0.
- `bmad-sprint-status` documented as consolidated into `bmad-sprint-planning` (retained as a shim alias — the BMM 6.12.0 shim honors the legacy override fields).
- `bmad-create-story` / `bmad-dev-story` documented as shims (deprecated upstream in favor of `bmad-build`).
- **CI architecture restructured**: `ci-wait.sh` (shell script that waited for CI) replaced by `ci-status.sh` (shell script that reads `ci-status.json`) + two LLM workflows (`story-track-dev` at `post_dev_phase` + `story-track-review` at `post_review_result`). The two-stage architecture ensures every story that completes dev gets pushed + CI + MR, and stories that complete review get review modifications committed + pushed + CI + issue tracking.
- `code-review/complete.yaml` and `dev-story/complete.yaml` now `INCLUDE common/post-issue-comment` instead of inlining platform-specific glab/gh comment steps — single source of truth for comment posting logic.
- `story-track-dev` (bmad-loop plugin, `post_dev_phase`) now sets the story issue to `status::in-progress` after the trace MR is created. Uses `common/find-issue.yaml` + `common/update-issue-status.yaml` (no inline glab/gh calls). Skips silently on any failure. Skipped when the story is `awaiting-operator`. The "Do NOT track issues" constraint is removed.
- `story-track-review` (bmad-loop plugin, `post_review_result`) now references `common/find-issue.yaml`, `common/update-issue-status.yaml`, and `common/post-issue-comment.yaml` instead of inlining platform-specific API calls. CI green → `status::done` + close; CI red → `status::in-progress` + keep open + comment with failure details; issue not found → OUTPUT message + skip; comment fails → best-effort + OUTPUT message + continue.
- README: corrected the documented `module` key in `module-manifest.toml` from `issue-tracking` to the actual `bmad-issue-tracking`; added a Development setup section explaining that BMM core is not colocated in this repo.
- `common/update-issue-description.yaml`: header `Purpose` expanded with design note explaining the file is invoked only when an upstream artifact changes (5 known `complete.yaml` call sites), and the rationale for excluding it from label-sync.
- `common/sync-issues.yaml`: inline comment near the status-check block clarifying that body reconciliation is intentionally absent — label-sync and body-refresh are deliberately split.

### Added

- `common/post-issue-comment.yaml` extracted helper: posts a comment to a GitLab or GitHub issue via `glab api` / `gh issue comment`. Reuses the input contract (`issue_id`, `comment_file`, `host`, `project`, `project_enc`) common to other `common/` workflows. `EXPECT_EXIT: any` — callers handle non-zero exit as a soft failure (best-effort).
- `common/post-dev-complete.yaml` unified workflow: handles the full post-completion lifecycle (push, wait CI, write `ci-status.json`, update issue status, post comment, create MR) for three phases dispatched via `phase` variable — `create-story` (issue + MR draft), `dev-finish` (push + wait CI + update issue + comment + ci-status.json), `review-finish` (push + wait CI + post review findings + update issue final + optional merge).
- `common/post-build-dispatch.yaml` dispatcher: reads spec status (`ready-for-dev` / `in-review` / `in-progress` / `done` / `blocked` / `awaiting-operator` / `draft`) and routes to the right phase of `post-dev-complete.yaml`. Non-interactive (no merge prompt) — used by `bmad-build-auto.toml` `on_complete` (bmad-loop flow, unattended).
- `common/post-build-dispatch-interactive.yaml` dispatcher: same routing but sets `allow_merge=true` so `review-finish` offers the optional MR merge prompt. Used by `bmad-build.toml` `on_complete` (manual flow). `bmad-build-auto` never prompts — the merge is handled by bmad-loop's merge-back or manually.
- `common/post-dev-complete-{create-story,dev-finish,review-finish}.yaml` wrappers: thin wrappers that set the `phase` variable then INCLUDE the unified workflow. Used by the legacy skill overrides (`bmad-create-story`, `bmad-dev-story`, `bmad-code-review`).
- `common/write-ci-status.yaml` reusable workflow: writes `{worktree}/ci-status.json` from the `ci_status` + `pipeline_info` variables set by `wait-for-green-ci`. Used by `dev-finish` and `review-finish` phases.
- `common/ensure-issue.yaml` reusable workflow: finds the story's issue by title (scoped by prd label) and creates it if missing, with the story spec body, sprint key, epic and prd context. Used by `create-story` and `dev-finish` phases.
- `common/ensure-mr.yaml` reusable workflow: finds the story's trace MR/PR by source branch and creates it if missing, with the issue reference (same-platform `#id`, cross-platform full URL). Used by `create-story` and `dev-finish` phases.
- `bmad-build.toml` and `bmad-build-auto.toml` workflow overrides: route the `on_complete` hook to `common/post-build-dispatch.yaml`. Both flows (manual `/bmad-build` and bmad-loop `/bmad-build-auto`) now share the same unified post-completion logic.
- **bmad-loop integration** (unattended dev loop): the module now mirrors sprint-status maintained by `bmad-loop` (single writer of `sprint-status.yaml`, compatible status values).
- **Two-stage story tracking**: `story-track-dev` (at `post_dev_phase`) pushes code + waits CI + creates MR for every completed story; `story-track-review` (at `post_review_result`) commits review changes + waits CI + tracks issue only when review completes. Fixes bug where stories that skip review weren't pushed.
- **`ci-status.sh`** bmad-loop `[verify]` command (`assets/bmad-loop/ci-gate/ci-status.sh`, deployed by setup step 3c): reads `ci-status.json` (written by story-track-dev or story-track-review), exits 0 (green) or 1 (red with diagnostic). Replaces old `ci-wait.sh` (238 lines → 57 lines).
- `/bmad-bmm-issue-sync` is now **unattended**: new `common/find-prd-key.yaml` resolves `prd_key` from `prd.md` without a PRD worktree or prompts (fails closed); `common/mark-mr-ready.yaml` is a no-op when no MR exists. Run it after `bmad-loop run`, then `git push origin main`.
- `awaiting-operator` status support (bmad-loop): `status::awaiting-operator` label created and the issue stays **open** (external action pending, confirmed via `bmad-loop confirm`).

### Fixed

- **GitLab nested-group namespaces fixed**: the GitLab API requires the URL-encoded project path (`projects/un%2Fitu%2Fgenie-ai`, not `projects/un/itu/genie-ai`). `common/check-config.yaml` now computes `project_enc` and all `glab api "projects/..."` calls (issue sync, find/create/update issues, labels, board, code-review/dev-story comments, `ci-wait.sh`, `story-track`) use it — projects under group/subgroup namespaces work.
- `ci-wait.sh` (bmad-loop CI gate): configuration/environment errors now exit **126** (bmad-loop's env-fault class → the run escalates/pauses, budget resets) instead of 1 (fixable → futile repair burn → story defer). A red/timeout CI still exits 1 → `_fix_phase`.
- `ci-wait.sh`: platform resolved from `_bmad/custom/issue-tracking.yaml` (`git_platform`) so self-hosted GitLab/GitHub instances work; inline YAML comments stripped; glab/gh API or auth failures escalate instead of silently passing as "no pipeline".
- `story-track`: the trace MR now targets the **PRD branch** (`branch_patterns.prd`) instead of `main`, its title follows the module's convention `Story {epic}.{story}: {title}` instead of `CI: {branch}`, and a re-driven story's stale trace MR is **closed with a new one created on the current branch** (the GitLab API does not support changing an MR's source branch) — one active trace MR per story.
- `ensure-board.yaml`: added missing `--paginate` to `glab api projects/{project}/labels` — projects with >20 labels would miss status labels beyond the first page, causing board columns to not be created
- `find-issue.yaml`: added missing `--paginate` to GitHub `gh api search/issues` — could miss issue matches beyond the first 100 results
- `sync-issues.yaml`: four `uv run python` blocks referenced `sys.argv` without `import sys` (NameError at runtime) — added the missing imports
- All Python invocations use `uv run --no-project python -c` so `uv run` does not create `.venv`/`uv.lock` in consuming projects with a `pyproject.toml` (which `git add .` would otherwise commit into worktrees)
- `story-track-dev` and `story-track-review` now pass `prd_key` to `common/find-issue.yaml` — without it the search is unscoped and parallel PRDs collide on story keys (`1-3-login-form` in two PRDs would otherwise update the wrong issue).
- `dev-story/complete.yaml`: the `test -f /tmp/dev-story-comment.md` check now has a FALSE branch that skips the comment INCLUDE — if the user dismisses the implementation-summary prompt, the workflow no longer halts mid-execution.

### Removed

- `bmad-check-implementation-readiness` override — the skill was removed in BMM 6.12.0 (readiness validation folded into `bmad-sprint-planning`). Its "update issue descriptions if artifacts modified" behavior is not carried over; issue statuses are maintained by the regular issue sync.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-28

[compare v2.1.0...v2.2.0](https://github.com/jrevillard/bmad-issue-tracking/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0)

### Added

- `bmad-prd` unified override: merges `bmad-create-prd` and `bmad-edit-prd` overrides into a single `bmad-prd.toml` with intent-detecting workflows (BMM 6.8.0+). Legacy files retained for backward compat.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-20

[compare v2.0.1...v2.1.0](https://github.com/jrevillard/bmad-issue-tracking/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0)

### Fixed

- Story titles now use consistent `Story N.N: Title` format across create-story and sync-issues (was double-numbered or using raw key)
- PRD issue title harmonized between create-prd and issue-sync/prepare (both now use `"PRD: {prd_key}"`)
- Removed fragile exact-title verification in sync-issues — labels already scope the search to the right PRD

### Added

- Issue title formats documented in CLAUDE.md and README.md
- CI pipeline gate: dev-story waits for green CI before transitioning to review; code-review waits for green CI before merging MR. Polls every 30s with 30-minute timeout; on failure, agent fixes and retries.
- `common/check-mr-ci.yaml` and `common/wait-for-green-ci.yaml` sub-workflows (16 common sub-workflows total)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-05

[compare v2.0.0...v2.0.1](https://github.com/jrevillard/bmad-issue-tracking/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1)

### Fixed

- Use explicit workflow file paths in standalone issue-sync SKILL.md instead of INCLUDE syntax that agents can't resolve from plain markdown
- Story worktree now uses unique name based on branch path instead of hardcoded `story`, enabling parallel work on multiple stories
- Code review complete no longer asks user for verdict — reads it from sprint-status.yaml
- Code review complete no longer asks user about review comment — extracts Review Findings section from story file
- find-stories now reads sprint-status.yaml from each story worktree instead of the PRD worktree, correctly finding stories whose status was updated on their own branch
- Code review complete no longer asks user for verdict — reads it from sprint-status.yaml
- Code review complete no longer asks user about review comment — checks if file exists

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-04

[compare v1.4.0...v2.0.0](https://github.com/jrevillard/bmad-issue-tracking/compare/v1.4.0...v2.0.0)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: All BMM workflow overrides migrated from TOML pointers + markdown instructions to structured workflow YAML with INCLUDE sub-workflows
- `bmad-bmm-issue-sync/SKILL.md` simplified from 13KB markdown to thin pointer delegating to `issue-sync/prepare.yaml` + `issue-sync/sync.yaml`
- Issue sync split into `issue-sync/prepare.yaml` (steps 1-3) and `issue-sync/sync.yaml` (steps 4-6) — sprint-planning and sprint-status now only run steps 4-6
- `sprint-planning/complete.yaml` and `sprint-status/complete.yaml` replaced custom sync logic with `INCLUDE: issue-sync/sync`
- All `glab api --jq` replaced with `glab api | python3 -c "import json,sys; ..."` (glab has no --jq flag)
- All `| jq` removed entirely — zero jq dependency, python3 used for all JSON processing
- `gh api --paginate --jq` replaced with `gh api --paginate | python3 -c` (jq applies per-page, not concatenated)

### Added

- Structured workflow YAML language with 11 step types (SET, CHECK, RUN, WRITE, READ, LOOP, OUTPUT, INCLUDE, FILTER, STOP, CD)
- 14 new common sub-workflows: check-config, find-prd, find-issue, find-stories, create-issue, create-label, update-issue-status, update-issue-description, set-story-status, ensure-labels, ensure-dynamic-labels, ensure-board, sync-issues, mark-mr-ready
- 10 activation.yaml files — worktree setup and variable extraction before BMM runs
- 10 complete.yaml files — commit, push, issue/MR management after BMM runs
- 683 regression tests covering YAML syntax, CLI patterns, variable flow, include contracts, platform coverage, config requirements, Python compliance
- Recursive YAML parser in tests/conftest.py for parametrized test flattening

### Fixed

- `glab api --jq` flag does not exist on glab 1.53.0 — replaced with pipe to python3
- `glab mr list --json` flag does not exist — replaced with `--output json`
- `sys.stdin.read()` in ensure-dynamic-labels.yaml and mark-mr-ready.yaml — workflow variables are passed as sys.argv, not stdin
- `int(m.group(1))` crash in ensure-dynamic-labels.yaml — group(1) was `epic-3` (string), needed group(2) for the digit
- `gh issue edit --labels` does not exist on GitHub CLI — replaced with `--add-label`/`--remove-label`
- mark-mr-ready false positive when zero epic entries exist — added `epic_found` guard

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Story branch setup moved to activation steps (before BMM workflow) — the BMM workflow now creates story files directly in the story worktree, never on the PRD branch
- All workflows stay in their worktree after completion (instead of exiting) — the agent continues working from there; only code-review exits after MR merge

### Added

- Variable re-derivation fallback in on_complete blocks — if context is compacted between activation and on_complete, `{story_key}`, `{prd_branch}`, `{story_branch}` are re-derived from config and files
- create-story activation now asks for story key and creates/switches to story worktree before the BMM workflow runs

### Fixed

- create-story no longer commits on PRD branch — story files live only on story branches
- README override table: create-story now listed with `activation_steps_append` hook
- README branch strategy table updated to reflect new flow

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Config relocated from `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` to `_bmad/custom/issue-tracking.yaml` — survives BMM updates that regenerate the BMM config
- Activation steps in create-story, dev-story, code-review now search for PRD branch via pattern matching when prd_key is not on the current branch (e.g. `git branch --list 'feat/*/prd'`)
- Setup auth check uses `--hostname $HOST` for self-hosted instances

### Fixed

- Missing `-R "$HOST/$OWNER/$REPO"` on `gh pr list` in create-prd.toml
- Missing closing backtick in sync skill config path references (2 occurrences)
- Stale `_bmad/bmm/config.yaml` reference in module-help.csv, README.md, and CLAUDE.md

### Improved

- Activation PRD branch search instruction now explicitly tells the agent to use `*` in place of `{prd_key}` when prd_key is unknown
- README Enterprise row updated to reflect actual CLI flag behavior (`-R` on subcommands, `--hostname` on api only)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- `glab api` PUT requests for issue description now use `-F` (file upload) instead of `-f` (raw field) — descriptions were sent as literal file paths
- Replaced `--hostname` with `-R` on all `glab mr` subcommands (merge, create, list, update) — flag not supported outside `glab api`
- Replaced `[--hostname $HOST]` with `-R "$HOST/$OWNER/$REPO"` on all `gh` subcommands — flag only valid on `gh api` and `gh auth`
- Added missing `-R` flag on `gh pr merge`, `gh pr list`, and `gh pr ready` in sync task and code-review
- Specified exact cache path for TOML overrides in setup step 3 (was ambiguous)
- Defined `{default_branch}` resolution in sync task step 5 (was used without definition)
- Fixed misleading `--hostname` description in CLAUDE.md

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- Standalone sync skill (`bmad-bmm-issue-sync`) is now the single source of truth — removed duplicate `shared-tasks/` directory
- Setup copies the sync skill directly to `_bmad/_config/custom/` instead of from a separate shared-tasks directory

### Fixed

- `create-story` now pushes the PRD branch after committing story file and sprint-status update
- `bmad-bmm-issue-link` removed from marketplace.json (skill was deleted in 1.0.1)
- Marketplace.json version aligned with module.yaml

### Improved

- Branch variable placeholders (`{prd_branch}`, `{story_branch}`) explicitly defined at first use in CLI commands
- MR direction (story → PRD) repeated in code-review merge step
- `story_key` to `epic_num`/`story_num` extraction clarified in create-story
- Guard messages reworded: "the workflow will resume" → "then continue these instructions"
- Removed dead `prd_parent_issue` config option from sync task (was never set or documented)
- Added CLAUDE.md with architectural guidance for future development

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- Git worktree-based branch management for all workflows (create-prd, create-story, dev-story, code-review)
- Automatic branch and MR/PR creation during PRD and story workflows
- Branch pattern configuration (`branch_patterns`) in setup (step 6b)
- `prd_key` capture during `create-prd` activation (persisted to PRD frontmatter)
- PRD issue and draft PR/MR creation on `create-prd` completion
- Story issue and MR creation on `create-story` completion
- Implementation summary comment posted on `dev-story` completion
- Code review findings posted as comment on `code-review` completion
- MR merge prompt in `code-review` (asks user, then merges if confirmed)
- Commit and push steps in `dev-story` and `code-review` workflows
- TOML overrides for `check-implementation-readiness`, `correct-course`, `edit-prd`, and `retrospective`
- Uniform `branch_patterns` config guard across all activation hooks and `on_complete` hooks
- Conditional worktree cleanup: remove after merge, keep otherwise
- Optional host/project config for cross-platform issue tracking (e.g. code on GitLab, issues on GitHub)

### Changed

- Default PRD branch pattern changed from `feat/{prd_key}` to `feat/{prd_key}/prd` to avoid git naming conflict with story branches
- Migrated from patches to TOML overrides (requires BMM 6.4.0+)
- Sync task no longer creates branches or MRs (moved to create-story workflow)
- Minimum BMM version bumped to 6.4.0

### Fixed

- `glab label create` used instead of `glab api` for label creation
- `--raw-field` flag used for `glab label create` (form-data fails on self-hosted instances)
- Setup step 5 always asks for host/project when mismatch detected
- `prd_key` captured during activation instead of `on_complete`
- Epics read from `epics.md` instead of `epic-N-*.md`

### Removed

- `bmad-bmm-issue-link` skill (obsolete, sync task handles MR creation)
- Known issue workaround for git branch naming conflict (fixed by PRD pattern change)
